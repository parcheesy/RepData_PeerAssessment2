## Reproducible Research Peer Assessment 2

### Description

This respository contains materials for submission of the second peer assessment in the Coursera Reproducible Research course.

The goal is to explore the human and economic effects of various weather patterns using the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database.

### Raw Data

The data used in this project is Storm Data from the NOAA storm database. The data set can be downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2

The raw data contains measurements of human harm and economic damage for each weather event recorded. There is also some documentation of the database available. Here we can find information on how some of the variables are constructed and defined:
